# Ensemble-learning-for-COVID-19-diagnosis-using-COUGH-vid-dataset

During the last year, lot of scientific articles in the field of Bioinformatics concerned the use of Machine Learning for diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 suspected patients. Many state-of-the-art works compute predictions of diagnosis and risk through lung radiographs (X-rays) or lung computed tomography (CT) scans. However, these methods are certainly invasive and imply a cost.
In the present work we focused on cough audios, and wanted to understand if they contain useful information for the diagnosis task, permitting to get an accessible and rapid screeing method.
To date, none of audio pattern recognition methods have been used in medicine, maybe because it is difficult to imagine that an audio can contain such specific information.
So, we investigate on that: comparing many classifiers and stacking them to have more robust predictions
