# Ensemble-learning-for-COVID-19-diagnosis-using-COUGH-vid-dataset

This work is based on the publicly-available COUGH-vid dataset, which is considered to be the largest COVID-19 audio dataset.
We compared many classifiers and stacked them to have more robust predictions for the COVID-19 diagnosi task.
